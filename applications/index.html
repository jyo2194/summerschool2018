Building state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine and therefore I eagerly want to attend this course. I have always considered learning as a process of growing. In addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out opportunities for learning new technologies and want to stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. By attending this course, I see my both the wishes come true. This will allow me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional work in my future.Web-technology has always lured me, be it the basic front end techniques of HTML, CSS, Javascript or the backend technologies of php. As a result I created websites in my both the bachelors major and minor project. "getmyfood.com"- a food ordering and table reserving website and "Online Examination System". And now I am looking forward to take a step further into a new arena of technologies related to web-services/ docker.</p></blockquote>
	<blockquote><div class="centre"><h4>What was your biggest challenge with a web project so far?</h4></div>
	<p>When I was working in my first web technology project, the connectivity of the page with the database was a headache. Due to small mistakes of SQL commands it was really difficult to debug the code.It took 4 days to discover where exactly the typo was and then everything went as expected.

	In my socond project storing and retrieving the cookies and sessions values was becoming a trouble but with a little practice

	Also during developing another project, rest-ful Api's were not working properly which caused trouble and affected the overall progress of the project. I hope to overcome such kind of silly problems by attending "Rethinking the website" course. </p>
